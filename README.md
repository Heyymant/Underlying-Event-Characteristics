This project contains data analysis on 2 million events generated using PYTHIA 8 Monte Carlo Event Generator, for the measurement of underlying event characteristics. This was a course project for the course PH219 at IIT Bombay, and was supervised by Prof. Sadhana Dash.

The project is based on G. Aad et al., (ATLAS Collaboration), Physical Review D 83, 112001 (2011)

Our project report is present in pdf format and can be downloaded [here](google.com). 

The data file in each of the macros is named as "datafile.root"

The files starting with N correspond to macros dealing with Number of charged particles. 
The ones starting with P correspond to macros dealing with mean scalar sum of lead momentum.

The files ending with combined are related to figures 4 and 5 in the report.
The files ending with final are related to figures 2 and 3 in the report (individual multiplicity classes).
